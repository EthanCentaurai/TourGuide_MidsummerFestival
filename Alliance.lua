A Summon Ahune |QID|11691| |N|Tatics: Everyone in your party can summon Ahune once per day. So you will be able to fight him 5 times if you wish. Ahune is a two-phase fight. Ahune does not need to be tanked. During the first phase, have your tank pick up the largest add and have most of your DPS focus on it. One DPS should be designated to picking up and killing the other little adds. Mainly to keep them off the healer. Phase two will begin when you get a raid warning that says something like 'Ahune has retreated'. He will change forms and become vulnerable to damage so all DPS needs to focus on him until phase 1 begins again. Note that Ahune will drop different loot depending on if the instance is normal or heroic.|
